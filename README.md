# FFFilamentrecycling

Hello there! This thing is still work in progress. We aim to create a filament converter from 3mm to 1.75mm filament... at least in the short term. In the long term our goal is to design just another filament recycling device that will crack your messed up prints, bottles and any other plastic thing you feed it with.
The mechanical parts are based on the master thesis of one of our contributors. Maybe we will publish his work here too.

Main electronics of our project are a ESP32-WROOM and a MAX10 FPGA reading a CCD sensor. The rest is currently pretty much neglectable as in the future we will integrate everything neatly onto a beautiful PCB instead of the current setup with its off-the-shelf Arduino modules and loads of jumper wire.
